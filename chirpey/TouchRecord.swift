/**
 Contains the data from a single touch in the interaction square.
 
 - time: time since the start of the recording in seconds.
 - x: location in square in [0,1]
 - y: location in square in [0,1]
 - z: pressure/size of touch in [0,1] (so far unused)
 - moving: whether the touch was moving when recorded (Bool represented as 0 or 1).
 
 Includes functions to output a single CSV line representing the touch.
 Must be a class so that TouchRecords can be encoded as NSCoders.
