 * Quick-and-dirty log utility for debugging issues
 *
 *  Don't use this in production code (as it will briefly hold a lock), but it can be useful
 *  for debugging issues with realtime code, as it's much faster than using log statements and
 *  won't spam the console.
 *
 *  Use ABTestLogDump() from the debugger to dump the last 100 lines.
