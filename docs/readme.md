# MicroJam

![MicroJam in action](/assets/images/microjam.gif)

MicroJam is a mobile app for sharing tiny touch-screen performances. Mobile applications that streamline creativity and social interaction have enabled a very broad audience to develop their own creative practices. While these apps have been very successful in visual arts (particularly photography), the idea of social music-making has not had such a broad impact. MicroJam includes several novel performance concepts intended to engage the casual music maker and inspired by current trends in social creativity support tools. Touch-screen performances are limited to 5-seconds, instrument settings are posed as sonic "filters", and past performances are arranged as a timeline with replies and layers. These features of MicroJam encourage users not only to perform music more frequently, but to engage with others in impromptu ensemble music making.

### Step 2: Perform something.

Tap, swirl, or swipe in the blue square to make your own tiny performance! Afterwards, hit "play" to hear what you've created.

### Step 3: Change sound

Try changing the "sound scheme" in settings. Each sound-scheme in MicroJam is just a Pd patch - submissions are welcome!

## Research Goals

- encourage everyday music-making with smartphones
- investigate asynchronous and distributed smartphone performance
- create generative microjams to mimic user styles
