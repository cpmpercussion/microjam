Today MicroJam has launched in the iOS App Store! [Here's the link!](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1186738854&mt=8)

Thanks to the many beta testers, friends and colleagues who helped out along the way and special thanks to Henrik and Benedikte, former masters students at the University of Oslo, who have worked with my as research assistants to get the app to this point!

As always, comments or bugs are welcome over Twitter, and we will still be releasing beta versions as we work towards v1.1.
