A new update for MicroJam appeared in the iOS App Store today, this includes some updates to accessibility and some bug fixes in the interface which should make the app a bit smoother to use. Looking forward to seeing some [new cool jams](https://www.instagram.com/p/BnicvZ1FhO_/?utm_source=ig_twitter_share&igshid=vsl4evvpwppx)!
