I'm happy to announce that the first beta of MicroJam is out! I'm looking for a a few testers to make some tiny performances with this app so that we can explore what kind of music is possible with this interface.

If you're on iOS and want to try it out, get in touch with me [on Twitter (@cpmpercussion)](https://twitter.com/cpmpercussion). 

The interface is simple but functional so far, and it's a lot of fun to try out different styles of performance with the sound schemes I've included so far. If you're looking for a full-featured social app, MicroJam isn't quite there yet, but there's plenty here to start imagining the future of social music-making and lots of opportunity to make it a reality.

One of the cool things about MicroJam is that each sound scheme is a self-contained Pd file, so it's easy to add more to the app. If you would like to contribute, drop me a line! More info coming to the Github repository soon.
