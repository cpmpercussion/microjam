![Performing with MicroJam at IFI]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/musictechevent-microjam.jpg)

Last week we presented MicroJam at a [music technology event at the University of Oslo's Department of Informatics](http://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/research/projects/epec/news/2017-05-29-music-tech-event.html). While Maria Finkelmeier (Boston, USA) and Christina Hopgood were on hand to perform as an iPad/Percussion ensemble, we played a short improvisation with MicroJam to explore how the beta version could be used in live performance!

This performance was notable as it emphasised simultaneous ensemble improvisation, the _opposite_ of how MicroJam is designed to be played! So the group came up with some creative ways of using the reply mechanism and looping mode to create musical textures and parts while interacting on stage.

Great to perform to an appreciative audience of researchers, artists, and students and hope to play at Escape again soon! Here's the performance from the event:
