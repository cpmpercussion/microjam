Microjam is created by Charles Martin and other researchers as part of academic research at the University of Oslo. It is distributed freely for your enjoyment and as part of our research into new ways of making music with mobile computing devices.

This page informs you about information we collect and store from you when using the microjam.info website and the microjam app available on the Apple iTunes App Store.

## Information we access and collect

When using MicroJam, we use Apple's iCloud service to store musical performances that you create. **Performances** that you have created in microjam and your public **username** and **avatar image** are visible to others who use the app. 

We **do not access or collect your real name, email address, or any other personal data**, and we cannot access any other data from your iCloud account.

When you use the _robojam_ feature of microjam, your musical performance (but not your username) is sent anonymously to an external server to generate a response performance which is returned directly to your device. We do not store your performance on this server.

We study publicly available performances stored in microjam in order to study how users can make music with smartphones and mobile devices. We collect anonymous statistics about how robojam is used as part of our research and may report aggregated information regarding microjam performances and usage in our research publications. For example, we might analyse whether performances using a drum sound are different to those using a keyboard sound, and discuss the results in a paper. We might also use public performances to test and improve our robojam system.

You may delete performances from microjam at any time, if you do so, these performances will not be visible to other users or to us.

## Security

Our app does not transmit or store any of your personal data, or any type of password. All storage of information in microjam occurs using Apple's iCloud service within the iOS operating system. Communication with robojam is encrypted and occurs over HTTPS.

## Exporting or deleting your information

You may export or delete your information from inside the microjam iOS app.

## Sharing of personal information

We will not distribute your information to others without your consent. Performances that you save in microjam are public and will be visible to other users as well as us. This is because microjam is intended to be a _collaborative_ experience, where you view and reply to the performances of other users. If you do not want your performances to be public, you can use microjam without saving them, and can delete ones that you have already saved. 

## Childrenâ€™s privacy

Microjam is not intended for use by children under the age of 13.

## Information for users from the European Union

By using microjam and storing your performances and other information, you agree that we may collect, use, and store this information outside of the European Union.

## Your consent

By using microjam, you consent to the storage and use of your information according to our privacy policy.

## Changes to this privacy policy

If we change our privacy policy, these changes will be reflected in this website. A summary of changes so far is:

- July 10, 2018: First published to reflect first public release of microjam.
