## How it works

MicroJam is an ultra-simple social app for making music. There's three screens: a list of jams uploaded to the cloud, the jam screen for adding new performances, and settings.

### Step 1: Start a new jam.

You can browse other jams that have been uploaded or hit the "Jam!" tab to start a new one.

### Step 2: Perform something.

Tap, swirl, or swipe in the blue square to make your own tiny performance! Afterwards, hit "play" to hear what you've created.

### Step 3: Change sound

Try changing the "sound scheme" in settings. Each sound-scheme in MicroJam is just a Pd patch - submissions are welcome!
