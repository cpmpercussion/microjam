### Try out the beta

### Contribute

[MicroJam is open source and released under an MIT License so you're free to fork the project on Github.](https://github.com/cpmpercussion/microjam)

One area where contributions are welcome is the "sound schemes". Each of these is a Pd file that interprets touch data into sound. It's easy to make new ones and it would be great to have a few more in the app. The skeleton sound scheme is ["Chirp" which can be found here.](https://github.com/cpmpercussion/microjam/blob/master/synth/chirp.pd) Look out for more information on this aspect of the project soon.
